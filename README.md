# Pionierswoning-WikiHouse
First built WikiHouse as a test and showcase (finished feb. 2018) for the 20 WikiHouses project in Almere, Netherlands.
Started with the WREN system (as used in the MicroHouse) and changed it to a new system called SWIFT. Where WREN has a maximum span at 3,6 m is the span of SWIFT to 4,8 m. (WREN is more flexible for making window and door openings, SWIFT is more flexible in interior space) 

The files are updated with minor changes to version 2 of the WikiHouse chassis of the Pionierswoning, containing:
- Manual (pdf) with instructions how to build,
- CAD file (dxf) including all the parts for CNC-cutting,
- 3d Sketchup files (skp), including finishing materials inside and outside,
- Pictures of the construction as an extra help
- Calculations of the structural engineer
- And may be more to come later...

VERY IMPORTANT:
Find a structural engineer to do or check the calculations for fitting to local circumstances, laws and regulations.
Building this house is always on your own responsibility!
