# Pionierswoning-WikiHouse
First built WikiHouse as a test and showcase (finished feb. 2018) for the 20 WikiHouses project in Almere, Netherlands.
The files are updated with minor changes to version 2 of the WikiHouse chassis of the Pionierswoning, containing:
- Manual (pdf) with instructions how to build,
- CAD file (dxf) including all the parts for CNC-cutting,
- 3d Sketchup files (skp), including finishing materials inside and outside,
- Pictures of the construction as an extra help
- Calculations of the structural engineer
- And may be more to come later...

VERY IMPORTANT:
Find a structural engineer to do or check the calculations for fitting to local circumstances, laws and regulations.
Building this house is always on your own responsibility!
